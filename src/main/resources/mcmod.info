  "description": "NationCraft is a complete overhaul of Vanilla MineCraft. It was inspired by numerous sources, including history, and a large number of video games in which the developers have played. The goal is up to you. You can become a great leader and build a mighty empire, or you can be a rogue villain running from the law. The potential is endless.\n\nStart from an ancient era where you are limited to the tools of antiquity, and push the limits of your knowledge, unlocking more modern equipment over time...Good Luck",
